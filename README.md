This interface builds on top of the **React Image Annotate** library.

### Features
- Customize the labels shown by adjusting the threshold confidence value.
- Customize the attributes shown by adjusting the threshold confidence value.

### In Progress
- Revamp the code to work with a custom annotation interface.
  - Reason: While the React Image Annotate library works well, it provides minimal customization.
- Include additional features like hiding annotations once finalized.
  - Reason: Greater consideration for user needs.

### Using the Interface

Simply run `npm run start`
